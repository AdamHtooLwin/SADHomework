# Actual Coding
TestService -> for tests to use

hbiernate-ehcahce - interface for ehcache to integrate into hibernate

firstlevel caching - have object within a session
what if i want identity map across sesssions? -> 2nd level caching.

enable_selective -> only models i annotate will have 2nd level
all - all objects

use_query_cache - off -> will not  run twice.

ehcache.xml -> resurces folder

noargsconstructor for spring security

Address.java
EmbeddedId -> composite key

MapsID -> put the userID into id field (pk) instead of auto gen
JoionColumn is the FK of the user in the eployee table


Test Service
entitymnager -> allows me to access Entity
@Transactional -> complete within itself - recommended to take out
