The following table is the business logic that the project tries to implement.

| Product | Strategy |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Word Processor | Revenue recognized right away |
| Spreadsheet | 1/3 today, 1/3 in 60 days, 1/3 in 90 days |
| Database | 1/3 today, 1/3 in 30 days, 1/3 in 60 days |
